🌾 Agricultural Data Analysis Dashboard

**📊 Project Overview**
The Agricultural Data Analysis Dashboard is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze agricultural data across Indian states, districts, crops, and years.

**This project provides insights into:**
Crop production
Cultivated area
Yield performance
State-wise and district-wise comparisons
Year-wise trends of major crops
The dashboard helps stakeholders, analysts, and policymakers understand agricultural patterns and make data-driven decisions.

**🎯 Objectives**
Analyze total production, area, and yield
Identify top-performing states and districts
Compare crop yield trends over the years
Track performance against production targets
Provide visual insights using interactive filters

**📌 Key Features**
